# RedBlackTree

To implement:
- insert
  - Update colors on insert
- [DONE] ~~print inOrder~~
- [DONE] ~~search~~
- delete key
- sorted array
  - Confirm with Prof. Gallia about what he wants the function to do
- [DONE] ~~switch from double to std::pair\<int, T\>~~
- [Planned] QT GUI

Ideas:
  - Let T represent sites. Use QT or something along the lines of a C++ API to pull in ranking data from search engines for our presentation.
